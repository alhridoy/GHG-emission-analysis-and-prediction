# Analyzing the Impact of Municipal Solid Waste on GHG Emissions in the UAE

## Project Overview

This project investigates the contribution of municipal solid waste (MSW) to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Through extensive data analysis and machine learning models, we aim to understand patterns, predict future emissions, and explore the effectiveness of different waste management strategies.

## Datasets

The analysis utilizes several datasets, including:
- Historical data on GHG emissions from MSW.
- Population data and projections.
- Waste management practices and their GHG emissions.
- Economic indicators like GDP.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and structuring datasets for analysis. Significant variables such as population, GDP, and waste management practices were identified and isolated for further study.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilizing Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for visualization, we explored trends in GHG emissions, population growth, and waste generation over the years.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: 
   - A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model was developed using TensorFlow to predict future GHG emissions from MSW based on historical data and projections.
   - Performance metrics such as R-squared, RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), Willmott's Index of Agreement, MAD (Mean Absolute Deviation), and MBD (Mean Bias Deviation) were calculated to evaluate model accuracy.

## Results

- **Predictive Modeling**: The RNN model showed promising results with an R-squared value of 0.847, indicating a strong ability to predict future GHG emissions from MSW.
- **Trend Analysis**: Visualization of historical and projected data revealed significant insights into the impact of population growth and economic development on waste generation and GHG emissions.
- **Waste Management Insights**: The analysis highlighted the increasing trend of GHG emissions from MSW and the potential impacts of various waste management strategies.

## Conclusions and Future Work

The project underscores the critical relationship between waste management practices and GHG emissions in the UAE. The findings emphasize the need for sustainable waste management policies to mitigate environmental impacts. Future work could explore the integration of additional variables, alternative machine learning models for improved accuracy, and policy simulation to assess the impact of various waste management strategies.
